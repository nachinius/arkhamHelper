Unfortunately, this time, Pete can't hide, and there's nothing Duke can do to protect him. His nightmares have been growing steadily worse over the last month, driving him all the way here... to Arkham. Even the whiskey isn't helping much anymore. Soon, he won't be able to sleep at all. Still, there are always opportunities for a man who knows how to stay quiet... as long as he isn't too picky."
