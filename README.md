arkhamHelper
============

Helper to play the arkham horror game board.

## Purpose

This is a client app for helping with arkham playing.
However, for developing it uses node.js

## Usage

run 

    grunt serve
and it should run the node.js server and open
a browser at localhost:9001

For fully client app (no node.js), should be available
through some grunt build but I haven't tested
if works neatly.

## Develop

Run 

    grunt serve
and modify files as needed. It
should automatically reload.

## generated initial structure with

    yo angular

Yeoman is used for generating new angular's
services, directives, controllers, and misc. See

    yo angular -h
and https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular
